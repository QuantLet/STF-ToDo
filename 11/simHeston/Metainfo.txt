Input: 's0: starting value of the spot price process
        N: time endpoint
        mu: drift
        v0: starting value of the volatility process
        delta: time step size
        KAPPA: speed of mean reversion of the volatility process
        THETA: long-term mean of the volatility process
        no: 2-column vector of normally distributed pseudorandom numbers
        SIGMA: volatility
        RHO: correlation between the spot price and volatility processes
        method
        METHOD = 1- Euler scheme (with absorption for the volatility process)
        METHOD = 2- Euler scheme (with reflection for the volatility process)'

Output: simulation of Geometric Brownian Motion

Example: simHeston(1,4,0.04,0.02,2,0.04,0.3,-0.05,0.01)
